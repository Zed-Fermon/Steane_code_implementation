# Steane_code_implementation

This is a Python library for creating and encoding Qiskit QuantumCircuits 
using the \[\[7, 1, 3\]\] Steane code and magic-state distillation, as described
in the following articles:

[Steane, Andrew (1996). "Multiple-Particle Interference and Quantum Error Correction". Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A. 452 (1954): 2551â€“2577.] ( https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9601029 )

# Roadmap

I'm hoping to build this into a contribution to [qiskit-qec] ( https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-qec ) and the architecture of the project is likely to change drastically if that becomes an option.
